# Hashing-and-Hash-Functions

## Introduction 
This project involves managing a banking system using a hashmap to store bank account information. Each account is characterized by its IFSC code and account number.
### Key aspects include :
Maintaining accurate storage and retrieval of millions of bank accounts.
Experimenting with collision resolution strategies to handle hash function collisions.

# Strategies to be Implemented: 
&bull; Chaining
&bull; Linear Probing
&bull; Quadratic Probing
&bull; Cubic Probing
