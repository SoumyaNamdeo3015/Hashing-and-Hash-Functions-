# Hashing-and-Hash-Functions

## Introduction 
This project involves managing a banking system using a hashmap to store bank account information. Each account is characterized by its IFSC code and account number. <br>
### Key aspects include :
&bull; Maintaining accurate storage and retrieval of millions of bank accounts. <br>
&bull;Experimenting with collision resolution strategies to handle hash function collisions. <br>

# Strategies to be Implemented: 
&bull; Chaining <br>
&bull; Linear Probing <br>
&bull; Quadratic Probing <br>
&bull; Cubic Probing <br>
